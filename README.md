# Sales prediction using Kaggle NYC Property Sales dataset 
## First step: Trying to understand the data, what information we have
Querying the data we can see that those information is available in this dataset:
* BOROUGH
* NEIGHBORHOOD
* BUILDING CLASS CATEGORY
* TAX CLASS AT PRESENT
* BLOCK
* LOT
* BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT
* ADDRESS
* APARTMENT NUMBER
* ZIP CODE
* RESIDENTIAL UNITS
* COMMERCIAL UNITS
* TOTAL UNITS
* LAND SQUARE FEET
* GROSS SQUARE FEET
* YEAR BUILT
* TAX CLASS AT TIME OF SALE
* BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE
* SALE PRICE

Altough we have a lot of information in this dataset, some data that would be useful is missing, like number of rooms and property conservation level. Also it lacks of categorical classification of neighborhood, which i'll try resolve using One-Hot Encoding.
